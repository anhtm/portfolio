    experience: `This project resulted from my own frustration over wasting so much food in the kitchen. I designed the architecture of the mobile application (React Native) as well as the API (Express.js) and database (MySQL). I refactored an existing JSON dataset of over 600 different types of food with 25 categories and embedded a search algorithm to query efficiently. The development process was sometimes in difficult stages since I managed everything on my own and it was not easy wearing multiple hats at once. However, this has been the project that I'm most proud of because of its usability & functionality, and it has shaped me into a fullstack developer today.`

    experience: 'This was my second Hackathon - FreeCodeCamp JAMStack 2018. Since it had to be a JAMStack application (Javascript-APIs-Markup), our plan was to build a React.js application integrated with external APIs. The idea was to build a tool that is able to merge git commits and contribution accross different git hosting platforms (Gitlab & Github), hence gamify the tool to encourage beginner developers to contribute regularly. I led my team throughout 2 days of planning and implementation - I assigned tasks for everybody and made sure we all understand our own responsibility. I also managed discussions over how to design the application architecture, how to manipulate and extract accurate data from different APIs, or decision on CSS library usage. I have been able to learned and gained more confidence in leadership, workflow management, communication, and project planning skills. These aspects substantially contribute to the success or failure of a product.'

    experience: `This was my first Hackathon - Mission Hack 2018 Montreal. Our idea was to build an application that can aide users with interactive instruction when assembling a furniture (think of a digital IKEA manual). I was responsible for building a real-time interactive Vue.js application that projects user's progress based on camera's input. It was a great learning experience about time management and dealing with pressure. When I look back, there are absolutely unresolved bugs, or missing features, but we had had a succesful demo and won 1st prize.`

    experience: `I worked as a frontend developer for Cooktu, a startup platform with a primary focus is to build a community out of meal-sharing service. Our mission was to build a complete Single Page Application that served as a marketing entry as well as an end-user platform. My responsibilities included redesigning wireframes and prototypes of the application, and building the frontend architecture based on the design. I used Vue.js to handle data flow from our API, routing and authentication. I used several third-party technologies and and integrated them into the application. Looking back, what I have gained most while working with Cooktu was not just the technical advances but also the valuable lesson of teamwork and communication.`,

    experience: `
      This was my first fullstack application, which I built using Python-Flask framework.
      The idea was straightforward: to build a bucket list application with fundamental CRUD functionalities. I used SQLAlchemy (a Flask extension) as to set up the database schema. I found the most challenging part of the project was deploying the application as well as the database to Heroku platform. However, in retrospect, I learned a lot along the way and found myself turning more well-rounded into a fullstack developer role.`,
