    'I was part of a team of 3 developers, and worked as a frontend developer. Our mission was to build a completely frontend application that renders data from a backend JSON API, and is fully responsive across devices. My responsibilities include creating wireframes and prototypes of the application, and building the frontend architecture based on the design. I used Vue.js to handle and fetch data from our API, and Vue-router for routing and authentication. I learned a lot of new technologies and how to solve problems while implementing them into the application (Amazon S3 Bucket for photos management, Stripe.js for payment/payout procedures).',

      This was my first fullstack application, which I built using Flask framework.
      The idea was simple: build a bucket list application with fundamental CRUD functionalities. I used SQLAlchemy (a Flask extension) as to set up the database schema. I found the most challenging part of the project was the deployment on Heroku. I was unfamiliar with the process, and found unexpected bugs, which took me quite a bit of time for researching and resolving.`,
